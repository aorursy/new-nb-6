# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



from subprocess import check_output

print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))



# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
df_train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv", parse_dates=['timestamp'])

df_test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv", parse_dates=['timestamp'])

df_macro = pd.read_csv("../input/macro.csv", parse_dates=['timestamp'])
df_train.price_doc.mean()
df_train.price_doc.median()
# let us plot the price variable and see what this looks like

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 


y_values = df_train['price_doc']/100000000

y_values.hist()
# from the above plot it looks like anything above 25000000 could be an outlier?
